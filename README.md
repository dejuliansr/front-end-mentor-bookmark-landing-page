## My process

In this challenge I only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript didn't use any framework so as not to complicate the configuration

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

By working on this challenge, I was able to learn various important concepts in front-end web development. I will understand how to create semantic HTML structures, use Flexbox and grids for responsive layouts, and manage images and text well. Apart from that, this challenge taught me CSS applications such as the use of color, spacing between elements, and visual effects such as shadows and corner radii to create an attractive appearance, and I also learned the application of JavaScript which I learned this time. what is learned is used to display menu navigation when in mobile layout and validate input errors in contacts. Overall, it helped improve my understanding of responsive design and best practices in front-end development.
